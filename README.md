What is This?
=========

Educational content doesn't quite match the HTML model (especially educational books).
For example, HTML has no notion of glossary terms and definitions, exercise problems and solutions, equations, etc.

This editor provides a WYSIWYG way of editing such material.

It is also getting support for collaborative editing.

Under the hood it uses http://aloha-editor.org

 How can I contribute?
=======================

Fork it and optionally compile the coffee files using http://coffeescript.org

    coffee -c -w *.coffee toolbar/lib/*.coffee
